# Liquid Time-Constant Networks for Volatility Forecasting

This repository implements the methodology from my
Bachelor's thesis: *"Liquid Time-Constant Neural
Networks: A Continuous-Time Approach to Volatility
Forecasting"* (University of St. Gallen, 2025).

## Abstract

Addressing the limitations of discrete-time models
in handling irregular financial data, this
thesis explores Liquid Time-Constant Networks
(LTCs) ‚Äì biologically- inspired neural networks
operating in continuous time via ordinary
differential equations ‚Äì for daily volatility
forecasting. This work evaluates LTCs against the
RealGARCH model using a kernel-estimated
realized volatility measure derived from
high-frequency IBM stock data (2000-2024). The two
models are evaluated on their one-step-ahead
forecasts throughout the COVID-19 crisis and the
following years until 2024. LTCs, especially when
incorporating logarithmically-transformed time
intervals between observations, consistently
outperform RealGARCH, achieving exceptionally
high statistical significance outside the crisis
period. Trained in only a few minutes on a single
CPU core, the LTCs demonstrated exceptional
computational and data efficiency while hinting
at a non-linear relationship between market
closure duration and volatility dynamics.

## üöÄ Quick Start

This repository uses the
[Nix](https://nixos.org) package
manager to install the necessary packages and make
them available in a reproducible shell. This
ensures that you use the exact same python and R
packages that I did in order to make the results
more easily reproducible and generally avoid much
of the struggle with mixing packages from
different languages. For this you will need to
[install Nix](https://nixos.org/download/). It is
available on Linux, macOS, and Windows Subsystem
for Linux (WSL).

It is crucial that if you try to reproduce these
results you don't try to install the packages
yourself, for I used my own fork of the ncps
package, which implements the LTCs. This is due to
a bug in the original package, which is what you
would install using pip or something similar.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vxld100/ltc-volatility-forecasting.git
cd ltc-volatility-forecasting
nix develop
```
